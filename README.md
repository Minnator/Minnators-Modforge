## Information
This project is developed in my free time, so updates may not be frequent. If you are developing your own tool and are interested in using some of my systems or visuals, please ask for permission first. Iâ€™d be happy to discuss if and how they can be shared.

## Performance
I have put a focus on performance but due to my limited knowledge at the start of the project some areas might not be as performant as others due to the amount of work it would take to change them. I will try to improve them over time.
Overall depending on your mod size it should use between 320 - 420 MB of RAM.
Depending on your CPU the map performance can be impacted.

## Contributing
Currently I am not looking for any contributors, but if you are interested in helping out, feel free to reach out to me on Discord.
